This is a chatting and social media posts web app made with flask-socketIO (first time using it, so i had to learn it so thats why the project isnt perfect), 
submitted for #siege, hopefully i can make better websocket apps in the future,
although the chat is temporary and gets deleted when u refresh and all of that but im really proud of it for a first websockets project.
